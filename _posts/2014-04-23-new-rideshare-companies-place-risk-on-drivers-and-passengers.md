In recent weeks, we have come into contact with individuals within our community who are using their personal vehicles to provide for-hire public transportation services.

**For Potential Drivers**

The PTC encourages any individual who intends to use her or his private vehicle to provide for hire public transportation services, to contact their vehicle insurance provider to make sure the levels and type of coverage are appropriate for the actual use of the vehicle. Chapter 2001-299, Laws of Florida, and the PTC Rules require any person operating a public vehicle within Hillsborough County or any of its municipalities to have a Public Vehicle Driver’s License (PVDL). In order to obtain a PVDL, the operator must submit a PVDL application to the PTC. An applicant for a PVDL must show proof of a valid Florida Driver’s License. All applicants must also undergo a national criminal history background check through the FBI and a driving records check. In addition, each vehicle that is to be used in providing for hire transportation services must undergo an inspection and be permitted.

The PTC Rules and Florida Laws governing for hire transportation may be found on the PTC web site at www.hillsboroughcounty.org/ptc. The law provides that any person found in violation of Chapter 2001-299, Laws of Florida, or the PTC Rules are subject to monetary penalties and/or criminal prosecution.

**For Potential Passengers**

If you accept a ride from a driver not licensed by the PTC, please be advised that the vehicle may not be properly insured. This could leave you and other passengers without a means to obtain a full legal remedy for damages sustained. The vehicle also would not have a PTC approved mechanical inspection and may be unsafe. Perhaps most importantly, you and other passengers may be getting into a vehicle with a driver who has not been properly screened through a national criminal history background check through the FBI, and whose driving record has not been checked. You have the right to request to see the driver’s Public Vehicle Driver’s License (PVDL). If you suspect the driver is operating without a PVDL or is operating a vehicle that does not have the appropriate permit(s), you should note the license plate number and contact the PTC directly at (813) 272-5814.

While the PTC embraces entrepreneurial spirit and welcomes new industry to the Tampa Bay Area, public safety and professional enforcement of Florida Laws remains our focus. The safety of our community is very important to our mission at the PTC, and we will continue to seek ways to improve the public’s safety in the transportation industry within Hillsborough County. We invite you to visit our web site at www.hillsboroughcounty.org/ptc, or call us at (813) 272-5814, if you have any questions concerning public transportation within Hillsborough County.
